    <h1>Online hotel reservations</h1><br>
    <p>Online hotel reservations are a popular method for booking hotel rooms.Travelers can book rooms on a computer by
        using online security  to protect their privacy and financial information and by using several online travel
        agent to compare prices and facilities at different hotels.
        Prior to the internet, travelers could write, telephone the hotel directly, or use a travel agent to make a
        reservation. Nowadays, online travel agents have pictures of hotels and rooms, information on prices and deals,
        and even information on local resorts. Many also allow reviews of the traveler to be recorded with the online
        travel agent.
        Online hotel reservations are also helpful for making last minute travel arrangements. Hotels may drop the price
        of a room if some rooms are still available. There are several websites that specialize in searches for deals on
        rooms.

    <h1>Connections to air travel</h1><br>
    <p>Large hotel chains typically have direct connections to the airline national distribution
        systems(GDS,Sabre,Galileo,Amadeus and Worldspan). These in turn provide hotel information directly to the
        hundreds of thousands of travel agents that align themselves with one of these systems. Individual hotels and
        small hotel chains often cannot afford the expense of these direct connections and turn to other companies to
        provide the connections.
    </p><br><br>
    <h1>Large-scale travel sites</h1><br>
    <p>Several large online travel sites are, in effect, travel agencies. These sites send the hotels' information and
        rates downstream to literally thousands of online travel sites, most of which act as travel agents. They can
        then receive commission payments from the hotels for any business booked on their websites.</p><br><br>
    <h1>Individual hotel websites</h1><br>
    <p>An increasing number of hotels are building their own websites to allow them to market their hotels directly to
        consumers. Non-franchise chain hotels require a "booking engine" application to be attached to their website to
        permit people to book rooms in real time. One advantage of booking with the hotel directly is the use of the
        hotel's full cancellation policy as well as not needing a deposit in most situations
