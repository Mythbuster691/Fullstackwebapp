    <h1>Airline ticket</h1><br>
    <p>An <strong>Airline ticket</strong> is a document or electronic record, issued by an airline or a travel agency that confirms that an individual is entitled to a seat on a flight on an aircraft. The airline ticket may be one of two types: a paper ticket, which comprises coupons or vouchers; and an electronic ticket.
    </p><br>
    <p>The ticket, in either form, is required to obtain a boarding pass during check-in at the airport. Then with the boarding pass and the attached tickets, the passenger is allowed to board the aircraft.
    </p><br>
    <p>A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. Consequently, unlike other retail businesses, they do not keep a stock in hand, unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms and/or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or a group event. A package holiday or a ticket is not purchased from a supplier unless a customer requests that purchase. The holiday or ticket is supplied to the agency at a discount. The profit is therefore the difference between the advertised price which the customer pays and the discounted price at which it is supplied to the agent. This is known as the commission. In many countries, all individuals or companies that sell tickets are required to be licensed as a travel agent.
    </p><br>
    <p>In some countries, airlines have stopped giving commissions to travel agencies. Therefore, travel agencies are now forced to charge a percentage premium or a standard flat fee, per sale. However, some companies pay travel agencies a set percentage for selling their product. Major tour companies can afford to do this, because if they were to sell a thousand trips at a cheaper rate, they would still come out better than if they sold a hundred trips at a higher rate. This process benefits both parties It is also cheaper to offer commissions to travel agents rather than engage in advertising and distribution campaigns without using agents.</p><br>
